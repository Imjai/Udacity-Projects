#Neighborhood Map Project 

> Developed for Project of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**.

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. Heck, the icons even bounce like you expect them to.

There's also extra info pulled from the Foursquare API where available. This includes website URLs and phone numbers. 
The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries. 

It can also recalibrate itself based on your screen size. Try resizing the window!
